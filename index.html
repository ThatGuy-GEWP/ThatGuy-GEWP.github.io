        <h1 class="h1 fastFade">Info about me</h1>
        <p>Hello! Im Tim, also known as ThatGuyGEWP (GEWP said like GOOP), im a 19 year old programmer who's been coding on and off since i got my first computer at 11.
          <br>im mostly self taught from <b>many</b> personal projects over the years, most schools i went to when i was younger had really bad or no programming classes,</p><br>
          <p>but almost all of them had computers and an internet connection, things got a bit difficult when chromebooks came around but i was still able to code through various sites.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I make <em>alot</em> of stuff, not a lot of that stuff makes it to the internet sadly,<br> and a lot of it ends
          up finished and/or abandoned on my hard drive, its a bad habit im trying to break!</p>

        <h1 class="h1 fastFade">Programming languages i use</h1>
        <p>There is a couple im most likely forgetting, i can pickup and use just about anything in a couple hours if its interesting enough. (or you know, money)</p>
        <p>if i had to take a guess at my current experience level with the various languages i use/used, it would look like this</p>

        <h4>C#</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill csharp">88%</div>
        </div>
        <p>My main goto language for the past 3 years or so.</p>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill java">75%</div>
        </div>
        <p>what i used <i>before</i> C#, quickly becomes a very bloated dependent on versions that are 20 years old mess that i despise, but understand and can use well.</p>

        <h4>C++</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill cpp">60%</div>
        </div>
        <p>what i used for a year after Java and before switching to C#<br>
          <em>really</em> dont like how overcomplicated it is to just split code into files, headers give me headaches
        </p>

        <h4>GLSL Shaders and other flavors</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill glsl">57%</div>
        </div>
        <p>Vertex shaders, Fragment shaders, Geometry shaders, This even includes Godot's shader language!<br>shader
          programming is good fun for me personally.
        </p>

        <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill htmlcss">54%</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Good enough with it to make sites, as you can see!
        </p>

        <h4>Rust</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill rust">38%</div>
        </div>
        <p>+10% if its with Bevy</p>

        <h1>Honorable Mentions</h1>
        <hr class="hrB">
        <h4 class="light">Python</h4>
        <hr class="leftHr">
        <p><br>im not <em>really</em> into python these days, but it was my first language and i used it alot mostly on <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a> when they were a much smaller company, 
          <abbr title="this site mostly exists since the stopping of free hosting took down Tarkov Getter, and i needed a place to be able to use it!">and hosting was free</abbr></p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="light">Lua & LuaU</h4>
        <hr class="leftHr">
        <p>
          I learned alot of lua from various sources, Love2D, ComputerCraft, Roblox, and <b>many</b> games that use it
          as a modding language.<br>
          <br>LuaU is just a sandboxed version of lua but allows you to define and use types, lua by itself just guesses
          types much like python.<br><br>
          I have yet to see any big company that uses lua regularly, but if there ever is one i know lua inside and out, and have read through the entire documentation. 
          <br>(not LuaU, though there is only a few changes to the language itself)
        </p>

        <h4 class="light">Circuit and logic design</h4>
        <hr class="leftHr">
        <p>
          When i was a kid i always wanted to make a computer, i got inspired alot from those <br>
          minecraft videos where a guy just builds a 4 bit CPU with redstone, but i was still just a kid, never stopped me from trying though!<br><br>
          This eventually lead to far later in 2019-2022, and turned into me messing with various logic sims including a <em>very good</em> one called Logic World thats where
          i got most my logic design experience, especially in its alpha version "The Ultimate Nerd Game"<br><br> I then moved onto things like logisim. also got a mini tutor from an actual processor engineer in the logic world discord!<br>
          he gave me a big push in the right direction, and it eventually lead to me making my first CPU's in both Logic World and Logisim.
          <br><br>
          turns out most the complexity comes from the code, designing a simple 8-Bit or 16-Bit CPU is good fun! and in the process of learning about it, you pick up
          some things that carry over into regular programming. 
          <br>fully understanding the use of various bitwise operators was a nice plus<br><br>
          <p>Below is some more recent chips i made, they aren't competing with intel any time soon but they work!</p>

        <p>
          On steam alone i have <b><em>over</em></b> 870+ hours on blender, and have been using it on and off since i was 12<br> 
          Im still horrible at <em>making</em> art but if you have a concept or drawing i can translate it over to 3D in an afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or 2D! mostly with shader magic, i cant really draw at all, im a great programmer not a great artist.<br>
          However i am <em>fairly</em> good with shader nodes, they are just fun to work with.

        <h4>Godot</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">

        </div>
        <p>
          I have only made a few basic games with godot, but each of them have been almost painless to create, its a very
          well thought out engine and has support for just about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the custom language GDScript, its got alot of shortcuts which is nice but gets in the way
          when your looking for something specific, using C# with godot just <em>feels</em> janky though<br> and
          UI design is also a pain, i wish they just copied unity on that front.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone expects you to use version control for any corruption or save errors which i dont mind since i love git, but it isnt even packaged with godot when you install it.
          <br>and working in 3D is very jank and prone to errors.
        </p>

            </video>
            <div class="containtedSub">
              Godot has a fairly strict limit on how many lights can affect a single sprite (like the background), lots of jank going on in the background to shutoff distant lights

          </div>
          
          <div class="videoText">
            <p>
              This here is one of the better looking out of first couple games i made in godot,
              everything here is made by me from the code to the music, and i used this project
              (along with a few less good looking ones) to get adjusted to how godot does things.
              <br><br>
              I had big plans for this little game, they may be finished in the future, maybe not, who knows!
              <br><br>
              That outline also isn't baked in, its a custom shader i wrote with the help from a few tutorials,
              it allows expands the size of the player mesh with a vertex shader to make room for
              the outline itself, which wasn't in any of the guides for some reason and caused me a bit of a headache before i figured it out.

        <h4>Unity</h4>
        <div class="skillBar">
          <div class="skill unity">60%</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          That whole unity <q>situation</q> instantly stopped me from wanting to use unity for any
          future personal projects, and i haven't really used it since, as godot was more then enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, before all that i actually used to use unity for any and all games from 2018 forward,
          and made many projects, some that i actually finished! im proficient enough
          in unity to make just about anything and i personally think that unity's animation system is the best one i've seen in any engine so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current custom made C# game engine is based on an <abbr title="Entity Component System">ECS</abbr> that has similar
          wording, with GameObjects that hold Components, but functions much differently.
