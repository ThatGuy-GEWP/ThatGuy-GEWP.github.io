                            Another Unity game!<br />
                            Made over a week-ish.<br /><br />

                            Unity's built-in constraints, to put it bluntly, suck ass.<br /><br />

                            To get around this, I used Unity's compound collider system, it basically allows many
                            colliders to act and move as one big rigid body.<br />

                            The issue is the only way to do this is to remove all rigidbodies from two objects (and
                            sub-objects) you want to weld, move them in place, and then parent them to the same
                            rigidbody game object.<br /><br />

                            The assembly system I made basically handled all of that, kept track of welds, and validated
                            connected parts.<br /><br />

                            In my assembly system there were 3 types of constraints: a weld, a loose weld (that would
                            break when moving fast), and a nail.<br /><br />

                            Whenever the autoweld feature was used, In order to check for possible nearby welds, i would
                            have to check the distance of each weld to each other.<br />
                            To not spend 2 minutes waiting for sqrt operations for distance checks i made a custom Burst
                            job (that uses SIMD instructions), to process entire arrays of weld point vectors then
                            output their distances into another array.<br />
                            then i just had to check the newly caluclated distances.<br /><br />

                            The building system in general, was inspired heavily by the game Starbase.<br />
                            But the implementation was done painfully and slowly by myself without any help.
